[Codebattle](https://codebattle.hexlet.io/?_gl=1*wxgebc*_ga*MzA1MzcyNDc4LjE3MTQ5MzAzMDY.*_ga_PM3R85EKHN*MTcxNTM1NzEyOC4yODMuMS4xNzE1MzU4MTA3LjAuMC4w*_ga_WWGZ6EVHEY*MTcxNTM1NzEyOC4yOTIuMS4xNzE1MzU3ODQ0LjYwLjAuMA..) is a game in which two programmers simultaneously perform the same task in different programming languages. Whoever does it faster wins.

**Main features of the project:**
* Solving a speed problem against another player. Both players see each other's editor with code, test output, and can change the programming language during the solution
* The game can be played with anyone, with a bot or a friend (the game will be available at the link)
* You can choose a game by difficulty level. When creating a game, you can choose a specific game, otherwise it will be selected at random
* The problems are given in two languages - Russian and English
* Other users can follow the progress of the game
* The game has a chat room where registered users communicate
* The completed game is available in recording. The editor for entering the code looks like a player
* Users receive points, on the basis of which the rating is built for the week, month and for all time

## Technology
* Clojure
* Elixir (phoenixframework.org)
* JS (React, Redux)
